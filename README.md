## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure? 

I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by making sure to check for bugs frequently and write code in small blocks.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I create a list of requirements for the program, and start looking for ways to implement these features into my program.

## How do I approach designing software? 
I approach designing software by first making a list of requirements for my program. Then, I create pseudocode or a flowchart to get a vague idea of how my software will be structured. Once I've done this, I can start writing small blocks of code, and test them frequently for bugs and errors.
