# CS 320 - Automated Testing in Java

## Introduction
This repository contains projects from my Automated Testing course at Southern New Hampshire University. The focus is on using JUnit for testing Java applications. Each project is designed to demonstrate both coding and testing skills in various aspects of software development.

## Projects

### Project 1: Mobile App for Managing Contacts, Tasks, and Appointments
**Objective:**  
Create a mobile application that can manage contacts, tasks, and appointments. The app was also tested rigorously to meet all defined requirements.

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Writing unit tests
- Identifying and fixing errors

### Project 2: Software Testing Analysis
**Objective:**  
Analyze different approaches to software testing and write a report on how to select the best testing strategies based on specific requirements.

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Analyzing testing strategies
- Meeting project requirements through targeted testing

## Course Goals
- Learn software testing techniques and strategies
- Understand the software development lifecycle
- Conduct requirement analysis, verification, and validation
- Gain hands-on experience with unit testing

## Reflections

### Automated vs Manual Testing  
Automated testing through JUnit played a significant role in these projects. However, manual code review also proved valuable in identifying issues that automated tests may not catch.

### Understanding User Needs  
User requirements were the guiding factor in the design and testing of all projects. Balancing user demands with technical limitations was a consistent consideration throughout the development process.

### Approach to Software Design  
The development process began with a general idea of the final product, followed by the incremental building of individual components. Regular code reviews were done to spot opportunities for improvements and code efficiency.

## Conclusion
This repository is a collection of my work related to automated testing in Java, and it showcases my growing skills in this area. The projects, along with their documentation, offer a detailed view of my hands-on experience. Feel free to reach out for more information or further discussions.
